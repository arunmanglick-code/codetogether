            Use this class as an API for Red Gate ANTS Profiler. It controls the parts of your 
            application to profile, and then while your application is executing, use it to 
            take snapshots on demand. Note that you must run the application from within the 
            ANTS Profiler UI. The methods for this class are the same as the commands that 
            are available in the UI; however the API does not provide a ‘stop profiling’ method.
